%6 participants ($p01, p04, p05, p10, p11, p15$) 
%with mean and standard deviation (SD) age of mean=19.5 (SD=0.83) years.

\begin{block}{Human-Humanoid Imitation Activity*}
20 participants with mean and standard deviation (SD) age of 
mean=19.8 (SD=1.39) years, being four females and sixteen males.
\end{block}

*Originally, 23 right-handed healthy participants were invited for 
two experiments, however some of these were not considered in the 
analysis due to technical problems with IMU's.
