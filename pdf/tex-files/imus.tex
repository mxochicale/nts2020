For 2 minutes of data collection there were issues of \\
* drift in time when using 4 inertial sensors, and \\ 
* disconnections to bluetooth module

%* NeMEMsi and MTi-30 in terms of standard deviation 
%of the noise of each component of the Euler angles at a stated state are lower 
%than 0.1 degrees. 
%
%* Data streaming can be set up to be streamed at 25 Hz, 50 Hz and 100Hz which
%affects the power consumption from 29mAh, 32mAh and 35mAh, respectively.
